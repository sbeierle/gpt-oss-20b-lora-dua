"id,prompt","id,prompt} values (1,'What is the difference between # and #?');
```

But again not.

But the user may want to know: ""What is difference between # and #?"".

Ok.

Now produce final answer.

But we also might want to mention that the difference arises from quoting: `#` is not recognized as string; It's used to start a comment. So the query fails because `#` is not recognized as a string.

Now summarizing.

But we can also mention that if you run `SELECT #` you will get error:

```
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near '#'.
```

But not necessary.

Now final.

Let's craft the final answer:

**Answer**:

In Saudi Arabia, a culture deeply rooted in tradition and hospitality, greeting etiquette is a vital part of daily interactions. Understanding these customs not only shows respect but also eases social integration. Here’s a guide to navigating common Saudi greeting etiquette in everyday life:

### 1. How to Greet

**Verbal Greeting**: The most common greeting is ""Salam Alaikum,"" which means ""Peace be upon you."" The response is ""Wa Alaikum Salam,"" translating to ""And upon you be peace."" This greeting is used universally across all interactions.

**Physical Greeting**:
